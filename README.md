# README

This repository contains `datasets`, `scripts`, and `experimental results` for our study.



The directory `data_collection_and_cleaning` contains the script for data collection and cleaning.

The task description for manual labeling, labeled results, the dataset for classification, and scripts for the various classification algorithms are included in the directory  `RQ1`. **Noteï¼š**The column "isTarget" in 8 groups' CSV files in `RQ1/manual_labeling` represents the categories for the commit messages (1 represents implicit and 0 represents explicit). The column "type" represents the three subcategories (1 for Bug Fixes; 2 for Prohibited Behavior;  3 for Code Optimization in Section 4.1.1) of implicit commit messages. If the "isTarget" is 0, then annotators need to set "type" to 0.

The directory `RQ2_3` contains manual check results for the stability of the best classifier from RQ1 in the subdirectory `manual_check`. In addition, the comprehensive experimental results of RQ2 and RQ3 in the paper are in the subdirectory `result`. The `metrics.py` script is an implementation of the BLEU_M2, BLEU_M3, BLEU_DC, ROUGE-L, and METEOR metrics. Before running it, you need to change `y_txt` (the referenced message) and `hyp_txt` (the model's prediction) in the header of the file.

The dataset used for our proposed "Diversion" strategy as well as the different classification algorithms we tried are contained in the directory `RQ4`. Experimental results comparing the conventional "Mixed" strategy and our "Diversion" strategy are presented in the subdirectory `result`.

Note that due to the large size of the files of the best classification models in RQ1 and the "Diversion" strategy, we share them on Google Cloud. Given that the explicit and implicit subsets are also too large, we share them on Google Cloud as well. Related link:
